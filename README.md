# Stock Price Simulation and Risk Analysis in Python  

---

Hi, I’m **Nisarg** — a Research Analyst at Trent University with a Master’s in **Big Data Analytics**, passionate about applying statistical modeling, simulations, and risk analysis to real-world problems.  

This project documents my exploration into **quantitative finance**, where I combine my academic background in data-driven research with hands-on coding to simulate stock price behavior, assess portfolio risk, and analyze uncertainty.  

The journey starts with **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** to model individual stock dynamics, expands into **Monte Carlo simulations** across thousands of potential scenarios, and culminates in **portfolio-level risk modeling** using correlation structures, **Value at Risk (VaR)**, and probability of loss.

## 📌 What is Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)?  

GBM is a stochastic process commonly used to model stock price movements over time. It assumes:  

- Constant drift (expected return)  
- Constant volatility  
- Log-normal distribution of prices  

It forms the backbone of many financial models, including the **Black–Scholes option pricing model**, and serves as a natural starting point for Monte Carlo simulations.

## 🧮 How Geometric Brownian Motion Works  

At its core, GBM assumes that stock prices follow a continuous compounding process with both **deterministic growth (drift)** and **stochastic fluctuations (volatility)**.  

Mathematically:  

$$
S_{t+1} = S_t \cdot \exp\left( \left( \mu - \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \right)\Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot Z_t \right)
$$  

Where:  

- $S_t$: Price at time $t$  
- $\mu$: Expected return (drift)  
- $\sigma$: Volatility  
- $\Delta t$: Time increment (e.g., 1/252 for daily)  
- $Z_t$: Random variable $\sim N(0,1)$  

This ensures stock prices remain positive and captures realistic randomness in price paths.

## 🚀 What This Project Does  

- Simulates single and multiple GBM stock paths  
- Runs large-scale **Monte Carlo simulations** for portfolio risk assessment  
- Visualizes results with **path plots and histograms**  
- Applies **correlation structures** via matrix decomposition for multi-asset portfolios  
- Quantifies risk with **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **probability of loss**

## 💡 Why This Matters  

In my work and academic projects, I’ve focused heavily on **modeling uncertainty**, whether in financial, scientific, or operational contexts. This simulation project extends those skills to finance, showing:  

- How stochastic processes drive uncertainty in markets  
- How **Monte Carlo methods** can quantify risks that aren’t obvious from single deterministic models  
- How **portfolio correlation** affects diversification and downside protection  

For someone moving into quantitative research, trading, or risk analytics, these skills — **stochastic modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, risk metrics, and matrix-based correlation modeling** — are directly applicable.
